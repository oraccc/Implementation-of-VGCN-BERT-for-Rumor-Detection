## Implementation-of-VGCN-BERT-for-Rumor-Detection

> Further work about project "Improving Rumor Detection with User Comments". We use **VGCN** and **BERT** to extract global and local features from texts and apply **Attention Mechanism** for feature fusion to improve rumor detection performance even further.
